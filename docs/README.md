Advanced Code Obfuscator & De-Obfuscator: A Compiler-Based Approach to Secure Code Transformation
1. Introduction
1.1 Project Overview
The Advanced Code Obfuscator & De-Obfuscator is a compiler-based tool designed to enhance the security of Python source code by transforming it into an obfuscated form that is difficult to reverse-engineer while retaining its functionality. The project addresses the growing need for intellectual property protection in software development by providing a secure, scalable, and user-friendly solution for code transformation.

The system incorporates several advanced features, including:

AST-based transformations for obfuscation.
Base64 encoding for an additional layer of security.
A security key mechanism to ensure only authorized users can reverse the obfuscation process.
A mapping technique to securely store relationships between original and obfuscated code.
This project is implemented as a web-based application using Flask, providing an intuitive interface for users to upload code for obfuscation or de-obfuscation.

2. Objectives
The primary objectives of this project are:

To develop a secure and efficient tool for obfuscating Python source code.
To implement a de-obfuscation mechanism that ensures only authorized users can retrieve the original code.
To provide a user-friendly web interface for interacting with the system.
To ensure the system is scalable and capable of handling large-scale codebases.
To document the system comprehensively for ease of understanding and future development.
3. System Architecture
3.1 High-Level Design
The system is designed with a modular architecture, consisting of the following components:

Frontend:

A static web interface for user interaction.
Allows users to upload code for obfuscation or de-obfuscation and download the results.
Backend:

A Flask-based application that handles the core functionality of obfuscation and de-obfuscation.
Processes user inputs, performs transformations, and returns the results.
Mapping System:

A JSON-based storage mechanism for mapping original and obfuscated code.
Ensures secure and efficient retrieval of the original code during de-obfuscation.
Security Key Mechanism:

A unique key is generated during the obfuscation process.
The key is required to reverse the obfuscation process, ensuring only authorized users can access the original code.
3.2 Workflow
3.2.1 Obfuscation Process
User uploads Python code via the web interface.
The backend processes the code:
Tokenizes the input code using a lexer.
Converts the tokens into an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST).
Applies obfuscation transformations to the AST.
Encodes the transformed code using Base64.
A unique security key is generated and stored along with the mapping in a JSON file.
The obfuscated code is returned to the user.
3.2.2 De-Obfuscation Process
User uploads the obfuscated code and provides the security key via the web interface.
The backend retrieves the mapping using the security key.
The backend reverses the transformations:
Decodes the Base64-encoded code.
Reconstructs the original AST from the mapping.
Generates the original source code from the AST.
The original code is returned to the user.
